# TODOs

- From [react-arcgis](https://github.com/nicksenger/react-arcgis):
> If you need to support browsers lacking a native promise implementation, you will have to add a global Promise constructor polyfill to your project, as react-arcgis does not include one. I recommend [es6-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise).

- Add ErrorBoundaries: https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html
